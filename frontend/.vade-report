Implemented Vercel Speed Insights for React as requested.

Summary:
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights to monitor web vitals and performance metrics in the React application.

Changes Made:

1. Installed Dependencies:
   - Installed @vercel/speed-insights package (version ^1.3.1) using npm
   - Updated package-lock.json with new dependencies

2. Modified Files:
   - frontend/src/App.js:
     * Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react"`
     * Added <SpeedInsights /> component inside the main App component JSX
     * Placed it after the Footer component, inside the BrowserRouter wrapper
     * This ensures it's available throughout the entire application

Implementation Details:

The SpeedInsights component was placed strategically:
- Inside the BrowserRouter to ensure it works with the entire routing structure
- After the Footer component to avoid interfering with page layout
- Within the main App component to cover all routes and pages

The component is now active and will automatically:
- Collect Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Monitor real user experience data
- Send insights to Vercel's dashboard when deployed

Verification:
✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
✓ No breaking changes introduced
✓ Existing code structure preserved
✓ Lock files updated correctly

The application is ready to deploy with Speed Insights enabled.
